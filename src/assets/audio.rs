//! Audio asset resolver.
//!
//! Compiles user-declared `sfx` and `music` blocks into the flat byte
//! tables consumed by the runtime audio driver, and provides builtin
//! fallback effects and tracks for unrecognized names (so legacy
//! programs that `play coin` / `start_music theme` without declaring
//! them still make sound).
//!
//! ## SFX representation
//!
//! Each [`SfxData`] is:
//!
//! - A few *compile-time constants* (`period_lo`, `period_hi`) that
//!   the IR codegen emits as immediates in the `play` instruction
//!   sequence to trigger a new pulse-1 note.
//! - A raw *envelope byte stream* stored in PRG ROM under the label
//!   `__sfx_<name>`, consumed one byte per NMI by the runtime audio
//!   tick. Each byte is a complete `$4000` write (duty<<6 | 0x30 |
//!   volume). A trailing zero byte is the sentinel: the tick sees
//!   it, mutes pulse 1, and stops.
//!
//! ## Music representation
//!
//! Each [`MusicData`] is:
//!
//! - A single compile-time `header` byte cached in ZP by
//!   `start_music` and used by the tick to build `$4004` envelope
//!   writes on every note change. Bit layout:
//!   - bit 0: loop flag
//!   - bits 2-5: volume (0-15)
//!   - bits 6-7: duty (0-3)
//! - A raw `(pitch, dur)` *note stream* stored in PRG ROM under the
//!   label `__music_<name>`, terminated by `(0xFF, 0xFF)`. Pitch 0 is
//!   a rest; pitches 1-60 are indices into the period table.

/// - Noise: each byte is a complete `$400C` write using the exact
///   same `lcvvvv` encoding as pulse (the noise register has no
///   duty bits and ignores the top two). Trailing `0x00` is again
///   the mute sentinel.
/// - Triangle: triangle has no volume register, so each envelope
