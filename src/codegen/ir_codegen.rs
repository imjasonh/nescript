//! IR-based code generator.
//!
//! Walks an `IrProgram` and produces 6502 instructions. Uses a simple
//! strategy: each IR temp is assigned a zero-page slot in the function's
//! temp region. Operations load operands from their slots into A, compute,
//! and store back. This is not efficient but is correct and easy to reason
//! about. A proper register allocator would use A/X/Y directly for short
//! live ranges.
//!
//! Zero-page layout (shared with AST codegen):
//! - `$00` frame flag
//! - `$01` input P1
//! - `$02` scratch temp
//! - `$03` `current_state`
//! - `$04-$07` function call params
//! - `$08` input P2
//! - `$09` runtime OAM cursor (used by `draw` to assign slots)
//! - `$0A-$0F` reserved
//! - `$10+` user variables + IR temp slots
//!
//! IR temps are allocated starting at `TEMP_BASE` (`$80`), giving 128 bytes
//! (`0x80-0xFF`) for IR temp storage per function. Functions reset the
//! temp counter at entry.
